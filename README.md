# From Windows 11 to Linux: A Full Stack Developer's Journey

![I stand with Israel](./images/IStandWithIsrael.png)

Welcome to the From Windows 11 to Linux:

A Full Stack Developer's Journey repository!

In this repository, I document the comprehensive journey of transitioning from Windows 11 to Linux as the primary development environment for a full stack developer. Main reason for this migration is control over my privacy. Whether you're new to Linux or an experienced user, this guide aims to provide a step-by-step account of the transition process, highlighting challenges, solutions, and best practices.

Introduction
------------

After more than two decades of working within the confines of Windows, I've made the personal decision to break free from the clutches of ***"Big Brother"** technologies that relentlessly invade our privacy. In this pursuit, I'm transitioning to Ubuntu Linux, which, in stark contrast to Windows and iOS, shines as a symbol of privacy-conscious computing. While the Windows and iOS ecosystems often engage in extensive data collection without clear user consent, Ubuntu's open-source ethos and community-driven development champion transparency and privacy.

Furthermore, in an era where other operating systems are rapidly integrating AI co-pilots, Ubuntu stands strong in its commitment to safeguarding user data. Unlike certain AI-driven features that raise privacy concerns in Windows and iOS, Ubuntu's community places a heavy emphasis on user consent, transparency, and data control. This solidifies Ubuntu's status as the ideal choice for those like me who cherish their privacy in this increasingly surveilled digital world.

As the ever-evolving landscape of software development beckons, I find myself embarking on a journey to explore new platforms and environments. This repository chronicles my transition from Windows 11 to Linux, not just as a mere shift in operating systems but as a quest to enhance productivity, streamline development workflows, and harness the unique advantages offered by the Linux ecosystem.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before taking the plunge into the world of Ubuntu Linux, it's essential to ensure you have a solid foundation in place. Here are the prerequisites and considerations based on my own experience:

For more details, refer to the [Prerequisites](./docs/prerequisites.md).

Development Tools
-----------------

In the world of programming languages, compatibility is key. Each programming language must possess the ability to run seamlessly on different versions of compilers. This ensures that developers have the flexibility to work with various toolchains and environments, making their code accessible and adaptable.
