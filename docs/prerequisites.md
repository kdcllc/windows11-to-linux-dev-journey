# Prerequisites

Before taking the plunge into the world of Ubuntu Linux, it's essential to ensure you have a solid foundation in place. Here are the prerequisites and considerations based on my own experience:

## Technical Proficiency

1. **Operating System Knowledge**: A basic understanding of both Windows and Linux environments is crucial. Familiarize yourself with how both systems work and their fundamental differences.

2. **Programming Languages**: Proficiency in programming languages is essential. In my case, I've been working extensively with Microsoft technologies, including C#, VB.NET, JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML/CSS, and ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core. This background knowledge is valuable when transitioning to Linux.

3. **New Skill Development**: Keep in mind that learning doesn't stop. As I embarked on this journey, I was in the process of acquiring new skills, including GoLang, Python, and SPA frameworks like React/Angular/NextJs/PWA and Lit Element. These expanding skill sets enhance your adaptability in the Linux ecosystem.

## Ubuntu Installation Options

4. **Hardware Choice**: Decide whether you want to install or configure Ubuntu on your existing machine or opt for a new machine. Ubuntu offers a range of [certified desktops](https://ubuntu.com/certified/desktops?vendor=Dell&vendor_page=True&) that can simplify the installation process.

5. **Experimentation**: Before the actual transition, consider experimenting with Ubuntu installations on older machines. This hands-on experience will provide you with insights into the installation process and what to expect.

6. **Conversion Tutorials**: There are plenty of tutorials available that guide you through converting an existing Windows machine into a powerful Ubuntu development environment. Familiarize yourself with these resources to ease the transition.

7. **Resource Efficiency**: One of the significant advantages of Linux, including Ubuntu, is its resource efficiency. Unlike Windows, which tends to consume a lot of CPU and RAM over time, Linux operates more efficiently. This is particularly valuable for developers who need their machines to perform optimally for extended periods.

## Hardware Choice

8. **Laptop Selection**: Instead of converting an existing development machine, consider investing in a new laptop designed for development purposes. Personally, I chose the [Dell XPS 13 Plus (9320) Developer Edition](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-plus-developer-edition/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop/usexcucto9320rpl01), and I couldn't be happier with its performance. Your hardware selection can significantly impact your Ubuntu Linux experience.

With these prerequisites and considerations in mind, you'll be better prepared for a successful transition to Ubuntu Linux and a more efficient and tailored development environment.
