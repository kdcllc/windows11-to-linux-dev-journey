# Introduction

After more than two decades of working within the confines of Windows, I've made the personal decision to break free from the clutches of ***"Big Brother"** technologies that relentlessly invade our privacy. In this pursuit, I'm transitioning to Ubuntu Linux, which, in stark contrast to Windows and iOS, shines as a symbol of privacy-conscious computing. While the Windows and iOS ecosystems often engage in extensive data collection without clear user consent, Ubuntu's open-source ethos and community-driven development champion transparency and privacy.

Furthermore, in an era where other operating systems are rapidly integrating AI co-pilots, Ubuntu stands strong in its commitment to safeguarding user data. Unlike certain AI-driven features that raise privacy concerns in Windows and iOS, Ubuntu's community places a heavy emphasis on user consent, transparency, and data control. This solidifies Ubuntu's status as the ideal choice for those like me who cherish their privacy in this increasingly surveilled digital world.

As the ever-evolving landscape of software development beckons, I find myself embarking on a journey to explore new platforms and environments. This repository chronicles my transition from Windows 11 to Linux, not just as a mere shift in operating systems but as a quest to enhance productivity, streamline development workflows, and harness the unique advantages offered by the Linux ecosystem.

This table provides a comparison of various advantages and disadvantages between Ubuntu Linux and Windows for full-stack developers:

**Unlocking Development Freedom with Ubuntu Linux**

Having embraced Ubuntu Linux for my development journey over the past six months, I've gained a profound understanding of how Microsoft's strategies can inadvertently lock developers into the Windows ecosystem. This realization became strikingly transparent when Microsoft recently announced the [discontinuation of support for Visual Studio for Mac](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/what-happened-to-vs-for-mac?view=vsmac-2022). It underscores the inherent limitations that can arise when relying solely on proprietary tools and platforms. Ubuntu Linux, with its open-source ethos, has provided a refreshing alternative, offering greater flexibility, transparency, and the freedom to tailor my development environment without being tethered to a single vendor's agenda. It's a testament to the importance of choice and independence in the world of software development.
